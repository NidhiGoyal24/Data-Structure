        "\n",
        "**1) what are Data Structure and why they are important ?**\n",
        "\n",
        "--> Data Structures are specialized formats for organising, storing and accessing collection of data. They provide efficient ways to manage information based on its characteristics and intended use.\n",
        "\n",
        "--> They are important because :\n",
        "  - Proper data structure can easily manipulate data.\n",
        "  - It can easily search and store the data.\n",
        "  - It conserve the memory usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2) Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with example.**\n",
        "\n",
        "--> Mutable Data type : In this we change or modify the data easily.\n",
        "  - Lists are mutable data type.\n",
        "  - EX : list1 = [1,10,5.6,\"nidhi\",5+6j]  ## Mixed data\n",
        "         list1.append(\"Milk\")  ## Adding an item\n",
        "         del list1[2]  ## removing the item at 2nd index\n",
        "\n",
        "--> Immutable Data type : In this we can not change or modify the data.\n",
        "  - tuples are immutable data type.\n",
        "  - EX : tup1 = (10,\"apple\",True,\"banana,5.5)  ## mixed data\n",
        "         tup1.append(\"grapes\")  ## appending or modifying will cause an\n",
        "                                   eroor\n",
        "\n",
        "**3) what are the main difference between lists and tuples in Python ?**\n",
        "\n",
        "--> The main difference between lists and tuple is that, lists are mutable while tuples are immutable.\n",
        "\n",
        "--> It means we can change the content of lists but not tuples.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4) Describe how Dictionaries store the Data.**\n",
        "\n",
        "--> Dictionaries used to store data values in key:value pairs.\n",
        "\n",
        "--> Dictionary is a collectiona which is ordered, changeable and do not allow duplicates.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5) why might you use set instead of a list in Python.?**\n",
        "\n",
        "--> Sets do not store the duplicate values, so they use less memory than lists. As a result, sets take less time to search through while in lists it take more time.\n",
        "\n",
        "**6) what is string in Python, and how it is different from a list.?**\n",
        "\n",
        "--> Strings are sequence of characters used for representing textual data.\n",
        "\n",
        "--> String is enclosed in either in single quote('') or in double quote (\"\").\n",
        "\n",
        "--> while, list is a sequence of values which can be character, integer or can be another list.\n",
        "\n",
        "--> string is immutable i.e. non changeable while list is mutable i.e. we can modify it.\n",
        "\n",
        "**7) How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "--> In Python, tuples ensure data integrity through their immutability. Once a tuple is created, its contents cannot be changed, added to, or removed. This immutability guarantees that the data within the tuple remains consistent and unchanged throughout its lifecycle.\n",
        "\n",
        "**8) What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**9) Can lists contain different data types in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "--> Yes, lists contain different data types.\n",
        "\n",
        "--> EX : list1 = [\"nidhi\", 5, 5.8, 3 + 7j, True]\n",
        "\n",
        "--> lists is like our grocerry bag, can contain everything.\n",
        "\n",
        "--> int, float, boolean, complex, string etc all are included in lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "**10) Explain why strings are immutable in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "--> String in Python are immutable which means they can not be changed after they are created.\n",
        "\n",
        "--> EX : name = \"Nidhi\"\n",
        "         name[0] = \"R\"  ## it will throw an error\n",
        "  \n",
        "--> We can not update or change the string after declaring, it means once an immutable object instantiated its value can not be changed.\n",
        "\n",
        "**11) What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?**\n",
        "\n",
        "--> Dictionaries provide a significant advantage over lists when you need to quickly look up a specific value based on a unique key, as dictionaries are designed for fast key-based access, making them ideal for tasks where you need to efficiently retrieve data associated with a specific identifier, unlike lists which require iterating through elements to find a match, which takes more time.\n",
        "\n",
        "**12) Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.**\n",
        "\n",
        "--> We use a tuple if required need an immutable collection where the elements won't change after creation.\n",
        "\n",
        "--> EX : details of employee in organization and details of Id cards that Details cant changeable so we can use tuples.\n",
        "\n",
        "--> Tuples are generally faster and more memory-efficient than lists, making them better for fixed collections, especially as dictionary keys or when iteration speed is crucial.\n",
        "\n",
        "**13) How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "--> It's an unordered collection of unique elements, meaning it cannot contain any duplicate items. When you add elements to a set, Python automatically removes any duplicates. This makes it a perfect choice for scenarios where you need to store a collection of items while ensuring uniqueness.\n",
        "\n",
        "**14) How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?**\n",
        "\n",
        "--> The 'in' operation for the dictionary tests on 'keys'. Because the keys of the dictionary is a unique value. On the other hand, dictionary values can be duplicated like a list.\n",
        "\n",
        "--> On the other hand 'in' keyword can be used to test whether certain  a certain value present in a list or tuple.\n",
        "\n",
        "--> 'in' keyword is very useful to write conditional statements that will execute a block of code only when a value is found in a list.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**15) Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not.**\n",
        "\n",
        "--> No we can not modify the elements of tuple in Python because tuples are immutable.\n",
        "\n",
        "--> This means that once the tuple is created, its elements can not be changed, added or removed.\n",
        "\n",
        "**16) What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?**\n",
        "\n",
        "--> A nested dictionary is a data structure where a dictionary within another dictionary acts as a value, essentially creating a hierarchical organization of key-value pairs, allowing you to store complex data with multiple levels of relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "--> for example, we use a nested dictionary to represent employee information organized by department, with each department key containing a dictionary of individual employee details as values.\n",
        "\n",
        "**17) Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**18) In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?**\n",
        "\n",
        "--> For quick data look-ups, configurations, or caches, we generally preffer dictionaries. For ordered collections and sequence operations, such as maintaining a stack or queue, lists are more suitable.\n",
        "\n",
        "**19) Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?**\n",
        "\n",
        "--> Dictionaries considered as unordered collection of data or objects because, dictionaries do not maintain any inherent order of the items based on when they were added.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   Their primary function is fast key-based access, and they are not intended to be used as ordered collections like lists or tuples.\n",
        "\n",
        "**20) Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.**\n",
        "\n",
        "--> lists are ordered collections of items that are accessed by index, while dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs that are accessed by key.\n",
        "\n",
        "--> Dictionaries are faster for lookups, while lists are faster for ordered operations like sorting.\n",
        "\n",
        "--> Data retrieval :\n",
        "* Lists: Elements are accessed by index, which is an integer that starts at zero.\n",
        "* Dictionaries: Elements are accessed by key, which can be of any data type."
